# Frequently asked questions and motivation


### Why don't you use webpack as a bundler

- Because the goal of the HTML version is to generate reusable HTML/CSS template, which may be later ported into different platforms, we need lot's of custom build tasks especially when building the templates. 


### May I edit the generated bundle.js file?

- It's strongly disadviced, because It's babel g.enerated file
